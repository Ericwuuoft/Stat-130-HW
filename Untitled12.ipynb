    "Analysis 1: confidence interval for Average Life satisfaction \n",
    "Research question:  Average Life Satisfaction \n",
    "Variables and Data collection \n",
    "For this analysis I will explore the wellness_ life satisfaction Variable from the CSCS dataset. This variable captures the self-reported life satisfaction level of participants, The satisfaction ranges from 1 to 10 where higher values indicate higher-level indicates a higher level of satisfaction. We will use the variables to estimate the overall average level of life with a confidence interval to understand the uncertainty around the estimated mean. \n",
    "Data visualization and Pre-assumptions \n",
    "The visualization I would use for this analysis is a histogram. A histogram could help me understand the distribution of life satisfaction scores. And will help identify if the data is normally distributed or if there is any significant deviation such as skewness or outliers.\n",
    "My pre assumption is that calculating the confidence interval is that the  sample data is approximately normally distributed, which make scenes to give the large sample size。\n",
    "Analysis Method \n",
    "For the analysis method I would calculate a 95% confidence interval for the mean life satisfaction score using the normal approximation. The formula for the confidence interval is: \n",
    "Where?\n",
    "-Sample mean of life satisfaction scores\n",
    "-sample standard deviation\n",
    "-sample size \n",
    "-critical value for a 95% confidence level. \n",
    "Expected results. \n",
    "The result will include the average life satisfaction score of people during quarantine and the 95% confidence interval. A narrower confidence interval means that we have a more precise estimate of the average life satisfaction. And a bigger interval indicates more variability. \n",
    "Content similarity: it is kind of like TUT 4 about the coffee scores.\n",

    "Section 2 (linear regression equations)\n",
    "Research questions the relationship between Life Satisfaction and Personality/Wellness Score\n",
    "Variable and Data connection\n",
    "In this analysis i will explore the relationship between life satisfaction and various psychological personality captured by PSYCH_big_five_inventory_ variable. These traits include agreeableness, conscientiousness, extraversion, neuroticism, and openness.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary variable is life satisfaction score, and personality is the dependent variable.\n",
    "B) we will use the data collected from the Canadian social connection survey dataset.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Data Visualization and Pre-Assumption \n",
    "To better understand the relationship between the variable I think that scatter plot will be the best fitting amongst all the other graphs, also we will include a linear trendline to visualize any potential linear relationship amongst the data.  \n",
    "Pre assumptions\n",
    "We will validate the following assumptions for linear regression:\n",
    "-linearity: check if the relationship is linear or not.’\n",
    "-Normality of residuals: we will use a QQ plot and Shapiro-wilk test to test it\n",
    "-homoscedasticity- in this we will use residual vs. fitted value plots\n",
    "-Multicollinearity: calculate the VIF (variance inflation factor.)\n",
    "Analysis Method and Expected Results \n",
    "A)\tWe will use multiple linear regression to analyze the effect of the big Five traits on life satisfaction.\n",
    "B)\tWe would expect to find a positive relationship between traits like extraversion or agreeableness and life satisfaction, and negative relationship with neuroticism.\n",
    "C)\tThese results can help us identify rather or not that personality traits are linked to better well-being, aiding in the design of intervention to improve mental health.  \n",

    "Analysis 3 hypothesis testing\n",
    "Variables and Data collection\n",
    "Research Question: the question I will be examing  is whether visiting family significantly affects an individual's subjective well-being?\n",
    "Data are from these two columns-\n",
    "1.\tCONNECTION_activities_visited_family_p3m and \n",
    "This variable indicates whether an individual has visited family in the past three month or not it is a categorical variable with possible response of yes or no.\n",
    "2.\tWELLNESS_subjective_hapiness_scle_always_happy \n",
    "This variable represents an individual’s subjective assessment of their happiness. It is a variable with level of agreement to statement such as strongly agree, agree, Etc.….\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Visualization and Pre-Assumption testing \n",
    "1.\tData visualization: Bar plot will be used to represent the frequency of individual who have visited their family’s vs people who have not visited their family. And a box plot will illustrate the distribution of subjective happiness scores for each group.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.\tPre-Assumption testing: since That hypothesis testing requires certain assumption. I will perform a normality testing on the subjective happiness variable using a sharpiro wilk test to assess if it follows or not a normal distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "Section3\n",
    "Analysis method\n",
    "Id assumptions are met I will us an independent t-test to compare the happiness scores between the two groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Expected results. \n",
    "Significant difference: if a significant difference is founded it suggest that visiting family positively will affect well-being however if there is not a significant difference then there is not relativeness. \n",
